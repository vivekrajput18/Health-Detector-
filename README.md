The disease detection app provides users with tools and resources to monitor their health, receive personalized recommendations, and access medical assistance when needed. Users can input symptoms, track health metrics, and receive potential diagnoses or recommendations for further evaluation. The app offers educational content about various diseases, symptoms, and risk factors, empowering users to make informed decisions about their health. While the app serves as a complementary tool to traditional healthcare services, it is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Users are encouraged to seek timely medical evaluation and treatment when necessary, especially for serious or life-threatening conditions. Overall, the app aims to facilitate early detection, empower users to take control of their health, and improve healthcare accessibility and outcomes.


Healthcare is rapidly evolving, with technological advancements playing a pivotal role in improving diagnosis and treatment. Our project aims to contribute to this evolution by developing a cutting-edge website for detecting seven diseases:
1-Brain tumor
Alzheimer's disease
Breast cancer
COVID-19 
Diabetes
Pneumonia
Heart disease
